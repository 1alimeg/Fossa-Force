>- prompt is displayed to the user asking "are you sure you would like to remove this friend from your friend list?"
>- OK is selected
>   - prompt disappears
>   - the friend will become unaffiliated with this user and the database will be updated
>- CANCEL is selected
>   - the prompt disappears
>   - no update made to the database and the friend remains in that users group.

> ### 游릭administrator responds to initial alert from student in distress
>
>- administrator previously logged in
>- administrator can be in any portion of the website
>- incoming alert displays in the center of the screen stating that student stress level show sign of distress
>   - in the background twilio sends notification to the users phone asking if they can
>   - new event logged and this users chat is added to the messaging center
>- DISMISS - the administrator dismisses the alert... and the user is added to the messaging center in the background
>- CHECK - the administrator respods to the alert and is taken directly the messaging portal
>   - live data from the IoT device is visible to the administrator
>- administrator is able to see conversation between user in distress and himself and see if friends were alerted to this users state

> ### 游Respond to alert in the even of friend in distress
>
>- case will be written for one particular user responding to a distress alert from another user whom they have previously added into their friend group
>- user does not have to be logged into the system to respond to distress situation from a friend
>- server side application senses a friend in distress
>- alert sent to administrator to start communication process
>- Twilio system triggered to send alert to the user who is in distress
>- if distress alert is confirmed or message automatically times out, location data of user in distress is sent back to foosa program
>- all associated friends are immediately contacted using twilio system
>- location data of all associated friends are requested
>- users have an option to share
>- all locations from users who shared location information is calculated to find the closest friend
>- if this location falls within a viable responce distance the location of the student in distress will be shared with the friend most easily able to respond
>- both the distressed user and the friend who is responding to the distress will be added into the admin message thread for the administrator to monitor and interact with.
>- only an administrator should be able to close and active distress situtation

> ### 游릭interact with student through messaging center in current distress
>
>- the administrator has previously logged into the system
>- a user has already had a distress event that was noticed
>- the system alerts the administrator to the distress event
>- new entry is made in the messaging system consisting of a conversation with that particular user
>- Twilio message is sent to the user in the background
>- messaging portal shows that this message has been sent
>- administrator awaits responce by the distressed user
>- once responce has been recived, the responce is added into the chat interface
>- other friends are contacted in the background and friend with closest location is asked if they can check on the distressed user
>- Once a friend responds and accepts the request by the user to help the distressed user, they also will be added into the chat for collaboration purposes
>- due to the SMS communication between the administrator and each of the users... the administrator will have access to both users involved but each user will only be able to interact with the administrator ( or with each other through their own channels)
>- once the distress event has been resolved the log of all communication will be saved for analysis
>- the location of the initating distress event will be added into the database for the administrator analysis screen

> ### 游General User interacts with system in the case of their own distress alert
>
>- this interaction will be limited to the user in distress
>- The system as it processes the live IoT data will calculate a stress score above a certain threshold
>- once this threshold has been passed, the system through the twilio API will send out a message to the user
>- The user will receive a message asking if they are safe
>- if they respond the appropriate safe responce, the alert will be canceled
>- if they message that they are in distress, or do not respond within an alotted time period, the system will automatically notify the administrator
>- this usercase flows directly into the following
>   - user responding to a friend in distress
>   - administrator using messaging portal to interact with user in distress

> ### 游마dministrator views dashboard view (more information on dashboard view to be discussed)
>
>- general user previously logged in
>- general user selects dashboard view from the sidebar menu
>- logic of each view will be pre-determined progrematically in application
>- latest data will be queried for in the database
>- graphs build uisng relevent frameworks
>- webpage will be populated with the latest up to date information for the user to view

## Stress Score
    - use ML to process or specific stress scenarios as outlined below
    - have to figure out specific timeline for events as opposed to snapshot sort of thinking with these scenarios

### Studying
- 游릭Pulse Rate - 
- 游릭body temp - 
- 游리priximity to unfamiliar objects -  (other people in the library)
- 游릭ambient noise -  (quiet speaking in library)
- 游릭stress indicator -  (low stress levels)
- 游릭user behaviour -  (sedentary)
- 游릭movement pattern -  (normal)


### Walking to Class/home
- 游리pulse rate -  (slightly elevated from walking)
- 游릭body temp - 
- 游릭proximity to unfamiliar objects -  (not many people you are near when walking)
- 游릭ambient noise -  variable but generally quiet
- 游릭stress indicator -  (low stress levels)
- 游리user behaviour -  (active)
- 游릭movement pattern -  (normal)

### Group Study
- 游릭pulse rate -  (sendentary with small increases due to joking around with friends)

- 游릭proximity to unfamiliar objects -  (more familiar devices around )
- 游리ambient noise -  (variable quiet speaking and can include loud joking around)
- 游릭stress indicator -  (low stress levels)
- 游릭user behaviour -  (sedentary)
- 游릭movement pattern -  (normal)

### Physical Activity
- 游댮pulse rate -    (variable from yellow to red due to level of activity)
- 游리body temp -   (variable yellow to red due to level of activity)
- 游리proximity to unfamilar objects -  (friends and strangers at the gym)
- 游리ambient noise -  (general higher level of noise in gym environment)

- 游릭ambient noise -  (generally quiet)
- 游댮stress indicator -  (high stress)
- 游릭user behaviour -  (sedentary)

### Active Assault Scenario
- 游댮pulse rate -    (high due to fear or activity)
- 游릭body temp -   (high due to stress or at least quickly ramping up)
- 游댮proximity to unfamiliar objects -  (single or multiple unfamiliar objects... though this has some flexibility due to the statistics regarding people you know harming or assaulting you... can be further discuessed)

- 游댮stress indicator -  (high stress indicated)
- 游댮user behaviour -  (stressed)
- 游댮movement pattern -  (irregular)

### Drunk (like bloody wasted and unconscious)

- 游릭proximity to unfamiliar object -  (no one around)
- 游릭ambient noise -  (quiet)
- 游리stress indicator -  (unconscious so I don't know how the stress indicator level is evaluated)
- 游릭user behaviour -  (sedentary)
- 游리movement patterns -  (irregular previous to unconscious state)








## Alert system

- incoming message
    - system sensed danger (are you OK alert)
    - 

- automated message, (Are you in danger)


- alert to close friends (would require constant location tracking)
    - mass alert to all friends (would you like to share location)
    - if location is actively being shared, the closest friend can be notified that their friend is in distress.


## Predictive Alert System (where administrator can see people who may be in danger or approaching a dangerous situation)
- alter the situation before something happens
- based off of "hot spot zones"
- based off of past user behaviour
- events that could alter user safety
    - calendar events could be implemented to put this into the predictive system.
- 




# UML data classes

- Attributes
    - first name
    - last name
    - mobile phone number
    - address
    - email
    - date of birth
